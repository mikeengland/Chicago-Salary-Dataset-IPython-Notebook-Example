# Chicago-Salary-Dataset-IPython-Notebook-Example

This is some very quick analysis I did when trying out/learning with Pandas on the Chicago city job salary dataset. Note, I used my forked (and modified) version of a module called gender-detector to get the gender of as many city employee's first names as I could (I could only get about 1/3 using this module). This module is forked from malev/gender-detector.
